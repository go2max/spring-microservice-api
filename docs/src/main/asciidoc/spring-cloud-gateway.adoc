== How to Include Spring Cloud Gateway

To include Spring Cloud Gateway in your project use the starter with group `org.springframework.cloud`
and artifact id `spring-cloud-starter-gateway`. See the http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page]
for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

Include the `@EnableGateway` annotation on any `@Configuration` class to enable Spring Cloud Gateway.

== Route Predicates

Spring Cloud Gateway matches routes as part of the Spring WebFlux `HandlerMapping` infrastructure. Spring Cloud Gateway includes many built-in Route Predicates. All of these predicates match on different attributes of the HTTP request. Multiple Route Predicates can be combined and are combined via logical `and`.

=== After Route Predicate
TODO: document After Route Predicate

=== Before Route Predicate
TODO: document Before Route Predicate

=== Between Route Predicate
TODO: document Between Route Predicate

=== Cookie Route Predicate
The Cookie Route Predicate takes two parameters, the cookie name and a regular expression. This predicate matches cookies that have the given name and the value matches the regular expression.

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # =====================================
      - id: cookie_route
        uri: http://example.org
        predicates:
        - Cookie=chocolate, ch.p
----

This route matches the request has a cookie named `chocolate` who's value matches the `ch.p` regular expression.

=== Header Route Predicate
The Header Route Predicate takes two parameters, the header name and a regular expression. This predicate matches with a header that has the given name and the value matches the regular expression.

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # =====================================
      - id: header_route
        uri: http://example.org
        predicates:
        - Header=X-Request-Id, \d+
----

This route matches if the request has a header named `X-Request-Id` whos value matches the `\d+` regular expression (has a value of one or more digits).

=== Host Route Predicate
The Host Route Predicate takes one parameter: the host name pattern. The pattern is an Ant style pattern with `.` as the separator. This predicates matches the `Host` header that matches the pattern.

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # =====================================
      - id: host_route
        uri: http://example.org
        predicates:
        - Host=**.somehost.org
----

This route would match if the request has a `Host` header has the value `www.somehost.org` or `beta.somehost.org`.


=== Method Route Predicate
The Method Route Predicate takes one parameter: the HTTP method to match.

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # =====================================
      - id: method_route
        uri: http://example.org
        predicates:
        - Method=GET
----

This route would match if the request method was a `GET`.

=== Path Route Predicate
The Path Route Predicate takes one parameter: a Spring `PathMatcher` pattern.

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # =====================================
      - id: host_route
        uri: http://example.org
        predicates:
        - Path=/foo/{segment}
----

This route would match if the request path was, for example: `/foo/1` or `/foo/bar`.

This predicate extracts the URI template variables (like `segment` defined in the example above) as a map of names and values and places it in the `ServerWebExchange.getAttributes()` with a key defined in `PathRoutePredicate.URL_PREDICATE_VARS_ATTR`. Those values are then available for use by <<gateway-route-filters,Route Filters>>

[[gateway-route-filters]]
== Route Filters

Route filters allow the modification of the incoming HTTP request or outgoing HTTP response in some manner. Route filters are scoped to a particular route. Spring Cloud Gateway includes many built-in Route Filters.
